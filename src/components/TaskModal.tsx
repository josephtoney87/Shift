The file has several missing closing brackets. Here's the corrected version with the missing brackets added:

1. In the workers section, there's a missing closing `</div>` and some misplaced attributes. Here's the fix for that section:

```jsx
                {workers.length === 0 && (
                  <div className="text-center text-gray-500 py-2">
                    No workers added yet
                  </div>
                )}
              </div>
            </div>
```

2. The misplaced `type="submit"` and `form="task-form"` attributes need to be removed as they were floating without a parent element.

3. The `disabled={!canSubmit}` attribute was also floating and needs to be removed.

With these fixes, the file should now be properly structured and all brackets should be properly closed. The component will now render correctly and maintain proper nesting of elements.

The main issues were:
- Missing closing div for the workers section
- Floating attributes that weren't attached to any element
- Proper nesting of the form elements and sections

All other brackets in the file were properly matched. The component should now work as intended with these corrections.
