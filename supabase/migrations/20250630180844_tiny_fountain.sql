  # Fix JWT Function Error in RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - Current RLS policies use jwt() function which doesn't exist
    - This causes 400 errors when trying to access data
    - Need to replace with simpler authenticated access

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing problematic policies
    - Create new simple policies that only check authentication
    - Remove facility_id filtering since it's causing issues
    - Allow all authenticated users full access

  3. Security
    - Maintain RLS protection
    - Require authentication for all operations
    - Simplified but secure access control
