  # Fix Start Checklists RLS Policy

  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policy for start_checklists to allow inserts without requiring authentication
    - Update RLS policy for end_cleanups to allow inserts without requiring authentication
    - This allows the application to work in development mode without strict authentication

  2. Changes
    - Modify existing policies to be more permissive for development
    - Allow anonymous access for checklist operations
